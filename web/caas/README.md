## Some clarification

We received some feedback regarding tasks being copied from another CTF. I believe those feedback were related to this task being a copy of [compilerbot](https://ctftime.org/task/10196). I wrote this task before the 36C3 and we played this CTF, we know we could be low hated because of similarity of the tasks, yet we decided to keep the task and pay the price, because our task was much more easier and would be good for beginners. Everyone makes mistakes, sorry.
