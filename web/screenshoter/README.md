## A few words

During the CTF, a guy who solved this challenge asked me on Discord if the PhantomJS was running with `--web-security=false`. When I replied that it was, he smiled and said that it wasn't much "real world scenario". I agree with him, but hey, people do crazy stuff, like commit credentials to github.
