## A few words

This task is totally based on this presentation [OWNING THE CLOUD THROUGH SSRF AND PDF GENERATORS](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JdIjHHPsFSgLbaJcHmMkE904jmwPM4xdhEuwhy2ebvo/edit#slide=id.p) by Ben Sadeghipour and Cody Brocious. Perhaps it is another task that lacks originality, but I was like "hey, maybe some guys doesn't knows those tricks".
