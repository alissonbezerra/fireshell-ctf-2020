# Simple Encryption

## Description

I found this small program on my computer and an encrypted file.
Can you help me decrypt the file?

## Some clarification

I know that this challenge lacks a bit of originality, but my idea behind was "what if someone use this in a production environment?". So, this challenge was mean to be easy and be more like a filler task. So, please don't hate me.
